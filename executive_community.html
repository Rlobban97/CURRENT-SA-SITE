Haven S-Hutchinson is a senior at the University at Albany currently studying Political Science with a concentration in Global Politics and minoring in Communications. Haven transferred to UAlbany in 2016 from Hudson Valley Community College where obtained an associates in Liberal Arts. After adjusting to life as a Great Dane he competed, and won a seat for Alumni Quad Senator for the Student Association senate. Going into Haven’s senior year, he was appointed under Roselynn Frempong as Associate Director of Community Engagement and Outreach. After a full semester as Associate Director he took charge of the department as of January 2018. He is currently on several committees involved with the community such as “The Walk to End AIDS” planning board, “The Rockefeller Dean’s Leadership Council” amongst other planning boards. As Director I believe that community outreach and service should be at the forefront of student life. Interactions between students and community members as whole are extremely important and should continue to take priority.

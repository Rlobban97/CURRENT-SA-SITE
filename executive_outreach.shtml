<p><img src=images/Roselynn_Frem.png align=right height="150" width="150"> Roselynn Frempong is a senior in both Political Science and English majors. She transferred to the University at Albany in 2015. During that time, she served for Student Association Senate as the Senator from Alumni Quad while being a part of the Community Engagement and Outreach Committee. She was Associate Director for the Community Engagement and Outreach Department in 2016- 17 year. She was subsequently appointed to the executive branch position of Director of Community Engagement and Outreach for the 2017-18 year. I am a Citizen Preparedness Representative for the Red Cross Disaster resiliency corps. She is an active member of Phi Alpha Delta Law Fraternity International, Pre-Law Chapter at the University at Albany. I am also an active member of the Model European Union at the University at Albany serving as secretary. I wish to develop a stronger network of students, student organizations, and community organizations. Students have such a tremendous impact on our community, and I am looking forward to implementing programs that would show that side.
